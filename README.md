# DoggoDec19
## About Project
Re-iteration of practice project [DoggoDec18](https://github.com/mittons/doggoDec18), for consolidation/refining of my skillset.

Uses/will use an image of the [MockDogApiDec19 project](https://github.com/mittons/MockDogApiDec19) for integration testing. Hooray for that!

Uses data from [TheDogApi.com](https://thedogapi.com/).

## Reflections
Again, as i mentioned in the I [DoggoDec18 README](https://github.com/mittons/doggoDec18), I need to create a seperate account for practice projects like this, projects that iterate mostly on what I already know and add only small amount of skill on top of that.
